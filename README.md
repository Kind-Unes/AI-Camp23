# AI Workshop Repository

Welcome to the AI Workshop repository! This repository contains materials from a comprehensive workshop on Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, these resources will guide you through data cleaning, word embedding using Word2Vec (Skipgrams and CBOW), and the Bag of Words model. The workshop employs popular NLP libraries such as Spacy, NLTK, and scikit-learn.

## Workshop Contents

### 1. Data Cleaning
- In the [Data Cleaning notebook](https://github.com/Kind-Unes/AI-Camp23/introduction.ipynb), we delve into the crucial process of preparing raw text data for analysis. Techniques include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing noisy or inconsistent data.

### 2. Word Embedding with Word2Vec
- #### Skipgrams
  - Explore the [Word2Vec Skipgrams notebook](link/to/word2vec_skipgrams_notebook.ipynb) to understand how Skipgrams are employed to create word embeddings, capturing semantic relationships between words.

- #### CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
  - The [Word2Vec CBOW notebook](link/to/word2vec_cbow_notebook.ipynb) focuses on the CBOW model, an alternative approach to generating word embeddings by predicting target words from their context.

### 3. Bag of Words
- The [Bag of Words notebook](link/to/bag_of_words_notebook.ipynb) introduces the concept of representing text as an unordered set of words, ignoring grammar and word order but retaining essential information for analysis.

### Presentations

- [Theoretical Overview](link/to/theoretical_presentation.pptx)
  - Dive into the theoretical aspects of the concepts covered in the workshop. Gain insights into the underlying principles of data cleaning, word embedding, and the Bag of Words model.
